# Hockey_DataBase_SQL

## Summary

### Objective of Project

- My objective here was to play with SQL and learn how to connect a database to a website. In this project, I took my two favourite hockey teams and created basics tables to store simple information (stats, players, positions, wins, losses, etc).

### What I learned

- The main problem I ran to in this project was constantly having to restructure my database, the frustrating part was after I had entered all the information (a whole list of players with appropriate stats). I would run into problems querying from the database simply and efficiently. Thus, I had to go back, remove all entries from the database and design the structure of the database all over again. For obvious reasons, this became very tedious, but I learned a valuable lesson. I learned how important it is to conceptualize the structure of the database before implementing, and refraining from moving to implementation to early. I realize the importance of making sure a database is in Normal Form, this way the database can scale effectively and make queries much more intuitive.
